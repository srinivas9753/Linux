# Fundamentals of Linux
# What Is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
It serves as the core interface between hardware and software, managing memory, processes, and devices.
While the term “Linux” often refers to the entire operating system built around this kernel, it’s technically just the kernel itself.
Distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian package the kernel with tools, libraries, and applications to create a complete OS.
Linux’s design emphasizes modularity, allowing the kernel to be extended through loadable modules rather than monolithic changes.

# Key Features of Linux
- Multiuser and multitasking
Each user can run independent processes concurrently without interfering with others.
- Portability
Runs on diverse architectures, from smartphones and embedded devices to supercomputers.
- Security and permissions model
Strong file-based permissions, role-based access (SELinux/AppArmor), and regular security patches.
- Stability and uptime
   Capable of running for years without reboot, making it ideal for servers and critical systems.
- Open source and community-driven
Anyone can inspect, modify, and redistribute the source code under licenses like GPL.
- Rich shell and scripting support
Powerful command-line shells (bash, zsh) and scripting languages automate tasks and configurations.
- Package management
Centralized repositories and tools (apt, yum, pacman) simplify software installation and updates.

# Why Linux Matters
Linux underpins much of today’s digital world:
- Over 90% of web servers run Linux, powering major websites and services.
- The majority of cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) relies on Linux VMs.
- Android, the world’s leading mobile OS, is built on the Linux kernel.
- In academia and research, Linux’s stability and customization make it ideal for high-performance computing.
It democratizes computing by eliminating licensing fees and allowing full transparency. Developers and organizations tailor Linux to specialized uses—from network routers to IoT devices—without vendor lock-in.
